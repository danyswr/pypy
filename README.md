# Virtual Pet Game Project Documentation

## Folder Structure

This project is structured using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. Below is an explanation of each folder and its purpose:

### 1. **application**
This folder contains application-level services, which define the use cases and coordinate high-level business operations.
- **Purpose:**
  - Acts as the middle layer between the user interface and the domain logic.
  - Orchestrates interactions between different components like domain, services, and repositories.
- **Example Content:**
  - Commands, queries, and application services for handling user inputs.
  
### 2. **domain**
The domain folder represents the core business logic of the application. It follows the principle of encapsulating the most important rules.
- **Purpose:**
  - Defines the business entities, their properties, and behaviors.
  - Represents the heart of the system.
- **Example Content:**
  - Classes like `Character` for modeling core entities.
  - Business rules, validations, and state management.

### 3. **repository**
This folder is responsible for data persistence and retrieval logic.
- **Purpose:**
  - Abstracts interactions with the data layer (e.g., database, file system).
  - Provides a clean interface for querying and storing entities.
- **Example Content:**
  - Repository interfaces and their implementations for managing objects like `Character`.

### 4. **service**
This folder contains additional logic or operations that don't belong to a single domain entity.
- **Purpose:**
  - Handles reusable and general-purpose operations.
  - Encapsulates logic that operates across multiple entities or domain layers.
- **Example Content:**
  - Services for calculating damage, logging game events, or performing randomization.

### 5. **ui**
This folder contains the user interface components and handles interaction with the end user.
- **Purpose:**
  - Manages rendering of the game and user input.
  - Provides feedback to users via labels, buttons, etc.
- **Example Content:**
  - `tkinter` GUI setup.
  - Functions like `setup_game`, `update_status`, and `restart_game`.

### 6. **config** (Optional)
This folder can store configuration files and settings.
- **Purpose:**
  - Centralized management of application configurations.
  - Keeps environment-specific settings organized.
- **Example Content:**
  - Configuration files for global variables, game settings, or user preferences.

### 7. **tests**
This folder contains test cases for all layers of the application.
- **Purpose:**
  - Ensures correctness of application logic and prevents regression bugs.
  - Verifies that each component behaves as expected.
- **Example Content:**
  - Unit tests for domain logic.
  - Integration tests for services and repositories.

## Folder Organization Overview
```
project-root/
|-- application/
|   |-- game_manager.py
|-- domain/
|   |-- character.py
|-- repository/
|   |-- character_repository.py
|-- service/
|   |-- combat_service.py
|-- ui/
|   |-- gui_manager.py
|-- config/ (optional)
|   |-- settings.py
|-- tests/
|   |-- test_character.py
```

### General Workflow
1. **User Interaction**: The `ui` components receive user input and pass it to the `application` layer.
2. **Application Logic**: The `application` layer processes the input, coordinates with `services`, and interacts with `repositories` to retrieve or persist data.
3. **Domain Logic**: The `domain` entities enforce business rules and handle state changes.
4. **Output**: Processed data is passed back to the `ui` layer for display to the user.

## How to Contribute
1. **Understand the Structure**: Familiarize yourself with the purpose of each folder.
2. **Follow Naming Conventions**: Ensure all classes and files are named appropriately for their function.
3. **Write Tests**: Add or update tests whenever you modify logic in any layer.
4. **Document Your Code**: Include comments for clarity and maintainability.
